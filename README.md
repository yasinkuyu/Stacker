# 🚀 Stacker

**Modern, High-Performance Local Development Environment for PHP, Nginx, Apache, and MySQL.**

Stacker is a modern, standalone development environment tailored for PHP developers who need speed, flexibility, and control. Built from the ground up in **Go**, it delivers a high-performance management layer that stays out of your way while providing everything you need to build, test, and debug.

Unlike traditional stacks that pollute your system with global dependencies, Stacker keeps everything self-contained within its own data directory. It empowers you to run multiple PHP versions (from 5.6 to 8.4) and switch between Nginx and Apache on a per-site basis—all running simultaneously. Every feature is baked in, from automatic SSL via `mkcert` to "Pro" tools like a built-in SMTP Mail Catcher, real-time Log Viewer, and a Dump Interceptor, giving you a premium developer experience entirely for free.

> 💎 **Premium features. Zero cost.** Everything you'd pay for in other tools is included for free.
